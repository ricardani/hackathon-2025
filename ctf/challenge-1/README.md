A malicious hacker group has managed to access one of our servers.

They have encrypted a very sensitive file with customer data and are asking for a ransom of 10,000 Meme Coins.

We managed to retrieve the bash history of the server (bash_history), as well as the encrypted file (customerdata.csv.crypt).
Can you help get the file back and save us a lot of money?
